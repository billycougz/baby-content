# Hush, Little Baby (Billy Goat Edition)

Hush, little baby, don’t say a word,  
Daddy’s gonna buy you a billy goat herd.  

And if that herd runs up the hill,  
Daddy’s gonna bring you a pail to fill.  

And if that pail spills on the ground,  
Daddy’s gonna build you a pen so sound.  

And if that pen falls open wide,  
Daddy’s gonna take you for a goat-cart ride.  

And if that cart gets stuck in the hay,  
Daddy’s gonna teach you how goats love to play.  

And if those goats all jump and bleat,  
Daddy’s gonna find you a treat so sweet.  

And if that treat falls in the dirt,  
Daddy’s gonna brush off all the hurt.  

And if those goats start to roam,  
Daddy’s gonna lead them safely home.  

And if the night gets dark and deep,  
Daddy’s gonna rock you till you sleep.
