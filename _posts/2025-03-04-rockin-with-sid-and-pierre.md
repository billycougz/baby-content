(ðŸŽ¸ *Verse 1*)  
Thereâ€™s a sloth named Sid, yeah, heâ€™s chillinâ€™ all day,  
Hanginâ€™ with Pierre, in the crib where they stay.  
One moves slow, the other slides fast,  
But together, man, theyâ€™re built to last!  

(ðŸŽ¸ *Pre-Chorus*)  
Sidâ€™s got the vibes, just takinâ€™ it slow,  
Pierreâ€™s got the style, with a waddle to show.  
Late-night cuddles, yeah, they guard the bed,  
Keepinâ€™ all the monsters outta Chloeâ€™s head!  

(ðŸ”¥ *Chorus*)  
ðŸŽ¶ Keep on rockinâ€™ with Sid and Pierre,  
Fluffy little friends, always right there!  
Dreams take flight with a sloth and a bird,  
Keep on rockinâ€™ in Chloeâ€™s world! ðŸŽ¶  

(ðŸŽ¸ *Verse 2*)  
Sid donâ€™t rush, he just takes his time,  
Pierreâ€™s got moves, yeah, he walks the line.  
One from the trees, one from the ice,  
But when theyâ€™re together, man, it feels so right!  

(ðŸŽ¸ *Pre-Chorus*)  
Sidâ€™s got the vibes, just takinâ€™ it slow,  
Pierreâ€™s got the style, with a waddle to show.  
Tucked in tight, yeah, they never leave,  
Keepinâ€™ little Chloe safe in her dreams!  

(ðŸ”¥ *Chorus*)  
ðŸŽ¶ Keep on rockinâ€™ with Sid and Pierre,  
Fluffy little friends, always right there!  
Dreams take flight with a sloth and a bird,  
Keep on rockinâ€™ in Chloeâ€™s world! ðŸŽ¶  

(*Instrumental solo ðŸŽ¸ðŸ”¥*)  

(ðŸŽ¸ *Bridge*)  
Yeah, the night gets dark, but theyâ€™re standinâ€™ strong,  
Two little heroes in a bedtime song.  
Hugginâ€™ up tight, â€˜til the morning light,  
Sid and Pierre make everything right!  

(ðŸ”¥ *Final Chorus*)  
ðŸŽ¶ Keep on rockinâ€™ with Sid and Pierre,  
Fluffy little friends, always right there!  
Dreams take flight with a sloth and a bird,  
Keep on rockinâ€™ in Chloeâ€™s world! ðŸŽ¶  

(*Outroâ€”fading guitars, bedtime lullaby vibes*)  
Rock on, Sid... rock on, Pierre...  
Keep on rockinâ€™... in Chloeâ€™s world... ðŸŽ¸âœ¨
