Through pipes and castles—where does Mario stay?

Breathing out fire—he’s really quite rough!

Grab one, grab twenty—now you're just fine!

What will pop out? A mushroom or guy?

Leap over lava—don’t take a fall!

Run through your foes—they all gotta go!

Always says, "Sorry, no princess at all!"

Echoing sounds as you run, jump, and leap!

V is for Villains, from Bowser to Boo,
They’ll chase you down—what will you do?

Hop right inside for a super-fast ride!

A hidden green mushroom? It could be there!
